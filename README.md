# ReelRate

ReelRate is a web app where you can search for movies from the MovieDatabase API, rate them, and keep track of your ratings.
[Go to the website (see demo)](http://reelrate-beta.netlify.app)

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, use the following commands:

npm install                                                                            
npm run dev


The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. Enter a movie title in the search bar on the home page.
2. Click on a movie to go to its movie page.
3. On the movie page, you can rate the movie using the star rating system.
4. To view and manage your ratings, go to the "Your Rates" page.

## Technologies Used

ReelRate was built using the following technologies:

- Next.js
- Redux
- CSS Modules

## Future Plans

In the future updates, I plan to add the following features:

- Watchlist page: a page where users can manage the movies they want to watch. Users will be able to add movies to their watchlist directly from the movie page.
- Search and filter: the ability to search and filter rated movies on the "Your Rates" and watchlist pages.
- Images loading optimization
- Rating comments: when rating a movie, users will be able to add a small text comment about the movie.
- Animations and transitions: we plan to add animations and smooth transitions between pages to enhance the user experience.
- Dark theme: the option for users to switch to a dark theme.
- CSS updates: we may replace CSS modules with Tailwind CSS to make the styles more maintainable.
